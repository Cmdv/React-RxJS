# react-rxjs

There really isn't that much information about using RxJS as a replacement to flux in react.
Because of this any contributions are welcomed :)

This is a simple React application using RxJS instead of Flux. This is an extension of [justinwoo](https://github.com/justinwoo) -> [react-rxjs-flow](https://github.com/justinwoo/react-rxjs-flow) with loads of extra features.

To get the React-router working I had great advice from:
[BerkeleyTrue](https://github.com/r3dm/thundercats) on this git issue -> [git post](https://github.com/rackt/react-router/issues/1230)<br>
and Anders Ekdahl on [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30469941/react-router-and-rxjs-data-flow/30475152?noredirect=1#comment49034545_30475152)

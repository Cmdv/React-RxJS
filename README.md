# react-rxjs

A simple React application using RxJS instead of Flux. So far this is purely a way of extending [justinwoo](https://github.com/justinwoo) -> [react-rxjs-flow](https://github.com/justinwoo/react-rxjs-flow) with extra features.



# Tools so far

* [RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS)
* [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel)
* [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack)
* [React-Router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router)




# Installing

Run `npm install` + `npm start`.
In your fave browser `open index.html`.


# ToDos:

* json interaction with API
* jwt Auth

# Contribution

There really isn't that much information about using RxJS as a replacement to flux in react.
Because of this any contributions will be greatly appreciated :)

To get the React-router working I had great advice from:
[BerkeleyTrue](https://github.com/BerkeleyTrue) on this git issue -> [git post](https://github.com/rackt/react-router/issues/1230)<br>
and Anders Ekdahl on [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30469941/react-router-and-rxjs-data-flow/30475152?noredirect=1#comment49034545_30475152)

Check out BerkeleyTrue's library [Thundercats.js](https://github.com/r3dm/thundercats) react + rxjs.<br>
